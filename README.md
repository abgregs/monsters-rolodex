# Monsters Rolodex

This is an app that covers React fundamentals including component lifecycle methods and basic design patterns for organizing and styling components. It fetches some placeholder user data and images from [https://robohash.org/](https://robohash.org/) to display a list of profile cards along with a live search field to filter the list of cards.

The app itself is relatively simple. The project involved reorganizing and rewriting our app to gain a solid understanding of important concepts like those listed below.

* Pure and impure functions
* Class components and lifecycle methods
* Functional components and side effects with `useState` and `useEffect`
* Asynchronous calls with the fetch API and promises
* Mapping arrays to elements in JSX
* Component organization and folder structure
* Passing and destructuring props
* Static type checking with TypeScript
